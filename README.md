# 🧭 Data Science Roadmap

This repository contains my **Data Science learning journey**, organized week by week.  
Each week focuses on one major Python library used in data science, with daily progress recorded under separate headings.  

Currently, the roadmap includes:
- **Week 1:** NumPy (Day 1–5)
- **Week 2:** Pandas (Day 1–5)
- **Week 3:** Matplotlib & Seaborn (Day 1–5)

I’ll continue adding more weeks and advanced topics as I move forward in my learning path.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to **document and track my consistent learning progress** in data science.  
By organizing topics week by week and day by day, I aim to:
- Strengthen my fundamentals in data analysis and visualization.  
- Build a structured self-learning plan.  
- Create a reference guide for anyone beginning their data science journey.
